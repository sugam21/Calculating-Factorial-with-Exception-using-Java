Part 1:


Write a
Java Program to find the factorial of ‘n’ integers (as command line arguments
CLA). Write your own exception “FactorialException” to validate integer values
to be in certain range. Sample call: java ExceptionDemo 8 – 6 14 abcd 5


1) Static
main method invokes another method “factorial()”


2) CLA
which are strings but interpreted as integer values.


3) The
user-defined exception class 


 


FactorialException  should have proper constructors / overridden
toString() method to display exception message along with the wrong input
number that had generated the exception.


NumberFormatException
(ill-formed CLA)


And


Your
Exception class


 


FactorialException  ( n<0 and n>15 )


 


Part 2:


Define an
exception class called “NOMATCHEXCP” that is thrown when the string from the
keyboard is not equal to “India”. Write a Demo program using try-catch block
that shows the use of this user-defined exception. Class NOMATCHEXCP should
have a parameterized constructor and the exception message generated should
show the line number and the erroneous String that was inputted by the user.
